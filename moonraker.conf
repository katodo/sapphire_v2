[authorization]
#login_timeout:
#   The time, in days, after which a user is forced to re-enter their
#   credentials to log in.  This period begins when a logged out user
#   first logs in.  Successive logins without logging out will not
#   renew the timeout.  The default is 90 days.

    sapphire.local
#   A list of newline separated ip addresses, ip ranges, or fully qualified
#   domain names that are trusted. Trusted clients are given full access to
#   the API.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and ranges are supported. Ranges
#   must be expressed in CIDR notation (see http://ip.sb/cidr for more info).
#   For example, an entry of 192.168.1.0/24 will authorize IPs in the range of
#   192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254.  Note that when specifying IPv4 ranges the
#   last segment of the ip address must be 0. The default is no clients are
#   trusted.
cors_domains:
    *.lan
    *.local
    *://my.mainsail.xyz
    *://app.fluidd.xyz
    http://klipper-printer.local
    http://second-printer.local:7125
#   Enables CORS for the specified domains.  One may specify * if they wish
#   to allow all domains, however this should be an option reserved for
#   client developers and not used in production.  A * can also be used
#   to specify a wildcard that matches several domains.  For example:
#     *.local
#     http://*.my-domain.com
#     *.my-domain.com:*
#   Are all valid entries.  However, a wildcard may not be specified in
#   the top level domain:
#      http://my-printer.*
#   The above example will be rejected.
#   When CORS is enabled by adding an entry to this option, all origins
#   matching the "trusted_clients" option will have CORS headers set as
#   well.  If this option is not specified then CORS is disabled.
force_logins: False
#   When set to True a user login is required for authorization if at least
#   one user has been created, overriding the "trusted_clients" configuration.
#   If no users have been created then trusted client checks will apply.
#   The default is False.

[update_manager]
enable_repo_debug: False
#   When set to True moonraker will bypass repo validation and allow
#   updates from unofficial remotes and/or branches.  Updates on
#   detached repos are also allowed.  This option is intended for
#   developers and should not be used on production machines.  The
#   default is False.
enable_auto_refresh: False
#   When set to True Moonraker will attempt to fetch status about
#   available updates roughly every 24 hours, between 12am-4am.
#   When set to False Moonraker will only fetch update state on startup
#   and clients will need to request that Moonraker updates state.  The
#   default is False.
refresh_interval: 672
#   The interval (in hours) after which the update manager will check
#   for new updates.  This interval is applies to updates for Moonraker,
#   Klipper, and System Packages, and is the default for all clients.
#   The default is 672 hours (28 days).
enable_system_updates: True
#   A boolean value that can be used to toggle system package updates.
#   Currently Moonraker only supports updating packages via APT, so
#   this option is useful for users that wish to experiment with linux
#   distros that use other package management applications, or users
#   that prefer to manage their packages directly.  Note that if this
#   is set to False users will be need to make sure that all system
#   dependencies are up to date.  The default is True.
channel: dev
#   The update channel applied to Klipper and Moonraker.  May be 'dev'
#   which will fetch updates using git, or 'beta' which will fetch
#   zipped beta releases.  Note that this channel does not apply to
#   client updates, a client's update channel is determined by its
#   'type' option.  When this option is changed the next "update" will
#   swap channels, any untracked files in the application's path will be
#   removed during this process.  The default is dev.

[power lampada]
type: tasmota
#   The type of device.  Can be either gpio, rf, tplink_smartplug, tasmota
#   shelly, homeseer, homeassistant, or loxonev1.
#   This parameter must be provided.
off_when_shutdown: False
#   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
#   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
#   The default is False.
on_when_upload_queued: False
#   If set to True the device will power on if the file manager
#   queues an upload while the device is off.  This allows for an automated
#   "upload, power on, and print" approach directly from the slicer, see
#   the configuration example below for details. The default is False.
locked_while_printing: False
#   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
#   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
#   the printer's power.  The default is False.
restart_klipper_when_powered: False
#   If set to True, Moonraker will issue a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to Klipper
#   after the device has been powered on.  Note: If it isn't possible to
#   schedule a firmware restart (ie: Klippy is disconnected), the restart
#   will be postponed until Klippy reconnects and reports that startup is
#   complete.  In this scenario, if Klippy reports that it is "ready", the
#   FIRMWARE_RESTART will be aborted as unnecessary.
#   The default is False.
#restart_delay: 1.
#   If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
#   of time (in seconds) to delay the restart.  Default is 1 second.
#bound_service:
#   Can be set to any service Moonraker is authorized to manage with the
#   exception of the moonraker service itself. See the tip below this section
#   for details on what services are authorized.  When a bound service has
#   been set the service will be started when the device powers on and stopped
#   when the device powers off.  The default is no service is bound to the
#   device.
#
# *** The following options apply to "gpio" and "rf" types ***
#pin: gpiochip0/gpio26
#   The pin to use for GPIO and RF devices.  The chip is optional, if left out
#   then the module will default to gpiochip0.  If one wishes to invert
#   the signal, a "!" may be prefixed to the pin.  Valid examples:
#      gpiochip0/gpio26
#      gpio26
#      !gpiochip0/gpio26
#      !gpio26
#    This parameter must be provided for "gpio" type devices
#initial_state: off
#    The initial state for GPIO type devices.  May be on or
#    off.  When moonraker starts the device will be set to this
#    state.  Default is off.
#timer:
#    A time (in seconds) after which the device will power off after being.
#    switched on. This effectively turns the device into a  momentary switch.
#    This option is available for gpio, tplink_smartplug, shelly, and tasmota
#    devices.  The timer may be a floating point value for gpio types, it should
#    be an integer for all other types.  The default is no timer is set.
#
# *** The following options apply to "tasmota" devices ***
#   Note:
#   If your single-relay Tasmota device switches on/off successfully,
#   but fails to report its state, ensure that 'SetOption26' is set in
#   Tasmota.
address: 192.168.1.182 
#http://lampadastampante3d/
#   A valid ip address or hostname for the tasmota device.  This parameter
#   must be provided.
#password:
#   A password used to authenticate requests.  Default is no password.
#output_id: 1
#   The output_id (or relay id) to use if the Tasmota device supports
#   more than one output.  Default is 1.
#
#  *** The following  options apply to "homeassistant" devices ***
#address:
#   A valid ip address or hostname for the Home Assistant server.  This
#   parameter must be provided.
#protocol:
#   The protocol for the URL to the Home Assistant server. Default is http.
#port:
#   The port the Home Assistant server is listening on.  Default is 8123.
#device:
#   The device ID of the switch to control. This parameter must be provided.
#token:
#   A token used for request authorization.  This paramter must be provided.
#domain:
#   The class of device managed by Home Assistant. Default is "switch".
#status_delay: 1.0
#   The time (in seconds) to delay between requesting a device to turn
#   on/off and requesting its current status.  This is a workaround used
#   to validate that Home Assistant has successfully toggled the device,
#   as the API is currently broken on their end.  Default is 1 second.
